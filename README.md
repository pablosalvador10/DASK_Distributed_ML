# DASK_Distributed_ML

Hey there !! 

Let me introduce you to my distributed friend, DASK. No worries if you don't have much experience in distrbuted computing or big data. If you are a python developer and you are loking for an alternative to SPARK, please take a look to my medium's articles. Dask will scale your Data Science skills.
